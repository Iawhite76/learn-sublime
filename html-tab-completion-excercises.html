<!-- Lesson 1: HTML Boilerplate -->

	<!-- Let's say you need to prototype an HTML index page real quick. 
	You COULD go online and pull down some boilerplate that would
	look a lot like this: -->

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<title></title>
	</head>
	<body>

	</body>
	</html>

	<!-- Or, you could do it the easy way. Place your cursor directly
	under the arrow ↓ and hit TAB. (Note: make sure your syntax is set to HTML or PHP.
	You can tell the current syntax by checking bottom right corner of your Sublime window. 
	You can set the syntax with `Command + Shift + P` then type html and select Set Syntax: HTML) -->

    <!--↓-->
	html

	<!-- Holy magic html boilerplate, Batman! -->


<!-- Lesson 2: HTML tags -->
	<!-- Need a <div>? How about a <ul>? An <a> tag, maybe? Place your cursor directly 
	after the following tags and hit TAB to see the magic. -->

	div
	p
	button
	ul
 	php
 	script
 	link
 	section

 	<!-- A tags are purdy special. Hit TAB once to auto complete the tag. 
 				 Hit TAB twice to enter the href. Hit TAB again to enter the link text! -->
 	a



<!-- Lesson 3: HTML tags w/classes -->
	<!-- Say, I need a div with a class name of "quick-fast-now", immediately! 
	Place your cursor directly under the arrow ↓ and hit TAB.-->
				  <!--↓-->
	div.quick-fast-now

	<!-- You can do this with pretty much any HTML tag. Go 'head, try a few below! -->
