<!-- Here are some of what I believe to be the most helpful default Sublime Text
tab completions. Specifics can be found here: https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/auto_complete.html -->


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Make sure your syntax is set to HTML or tab completion won't work.  //
// You can tell the current syntax by checking bottom right            //
// corner of your Sublime window. You can set the syntax with          //
// `Command + Shift + P` then type html and select Set Syntax: HTML    //

<!-- Exercise 1: HTML Boilerplate -->

	<!-- Let's say you need to prototype an HTML index page real quick. 
	You COULD go online and pull down some boilerplate that would
	look a lot like this: -->

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<title></title>
	</head>
	<body>

	</body>
	</html>


<!-- Instead, let's use default Sublime Text	HTML tab completion.
On the line below, type --> html <!-- and hit TAB -->







<!-- Exercise 2: Lorem ipsum Boilerplate -->
	<!-- On the line below, type --> lorem <!-- and hit TAB -->







<!-- Exercise 3: HTML tags -->
	<!-- Need a <div>? How about a <ul>? An <a> tag, maybe? Place your cursor directly 
	after the following tags and hit TAB to see the magic. -->

	div
	p
	button
	ul
 	php
 	script
 	link
 	section

 	<!-- A tags are purdy special. Hit TAB once to auto complete the tag. 
 				 Hit TAB twice to enter the href. Hit TAB again to enter the link text! -->
 	a

 	<!-- Some tags don't play nice, like header (<h1><h2>etc..) tags for example. If tab completion isn't
 	working for a particular tag try typing adding < and then typing the tag name. You should
 	see a dropdown list with options to autocomplete that tag. -->




<!-- Exercise 4: HTML tags w/classes -->
	<!-- Say, I need a div with a class name of "quick-fast-now", immediately! -->
	<!-- On the line below, type --> div.quick-fast-now <!-- and hit TAB -->



	<!-- Need an ID instead? There's a shortcut for that! -->
	<!-- On the line below, type --> div#my-new-id <!-- and hit TAB -->




<!-- Exercise 5: The amazing tag hug -->
	<!-- So I've got the following markup. Turns out this <ul> tag 
	needs to be surrounded by a div with the class name
	"my-class". Using a handy Sublime shortcut you may have learned 
	in another lesson, place your cursor at the beginning of the line preceding the opening <ul> tag,
	hit --> ⌘L <!-- until you've selected the next line directly after </ul> 
	(6 times by my count), then use --> ⌘^W 
	<!-- and type --> div class="my-class" <!--
	Notice this shortcut automagically surrounds the selected markup in a <div>
	and properly adds the class to just the opening tag. Neat, huh? -->

	<ul>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
	</ul>

<!-- Exercise 6: Closing tag shortcut -->
	<!-- This has nothing to do with tab completion...but it's a helpful tool for 
	dealing with HTML tags so I figured I'd throw it in this group of exercises.
	Below I have an opening HTML tag and some text. Instead of manually typing
	out the matching closing tag, try the key combination --> ⌘⌥. 


	<strong>So strong

	<!-- Yeah..so what? It's just one tag, right? This works for nested tags, too!
	To prove it hit `Command + Option + .` three times (or as many times as you have unclosed tags) -->

	<div><ul><li>Ima list item!
