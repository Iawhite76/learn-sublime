<!-- Here are some of what I believe to be the most helpful default Sublime Text
tab completions. Specifics can be found here: https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/auto_complete.html 

Some clarification on key commands
All of the keyboard shortcuts in these lessons involve at least one modifier key (Command ⌘, Control ^, etc) followed by predicate key which completes the shortcut and triggers the desired action.

For example, let's take the shortcut ⌘X
This means depress and hold the Command (⌘) modifier key and then press the letter 'X'.

If you see ⌘KK or ⌘K⌘K, this means depress and hold Control (⌘) and press the letter 'K' twice.

Should you come across several modifier keys such as ⌃⇧K
then this means depress and hold Control (⌃), depress and hold Shift (⇧), then press the letter 'K'

Each lesson should have a legend for the modifier keys as well as these instructions as a reminder. -->

<!-- Exercise 1: HTML Boilerplate -->

	<!-- Let's say you need to prototype an HTML index page real quick. 
	You COULD go online and pull down some boilerplate that would
	look a lot like this: -->

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<title></title>
	</head>
	<body>

	</body>
	</html>

	<!-- Or, you could do it the easy way. Place your cursor directly
	under the arrow ↓ and hit TAB. (Note: make sure your syntax is set to HTML or PHP.
	You can tell the current syntax by checking bottom right corner of your Sublime window. 
	You can set the syntax with `Command + Shift + P` then type html and select Set Syntax: HTML) -->

    <!--↓-->
	html

	<!-- Holy magic HTML boilerplate, Batman! -->


<!-- Exercise 2: HTML tags -->
	<!-- Need a <div>? How about a <ul>? An <a> tag, maybe? Place your cursor directly 
	after the following tags and hit TAB to see the magic. -->

	div
	p
	button
	ul
 	php
 	script
 	link
 	section

 	<!-- A tags are purdy special. Hit TAB once to auto complete the tag. 
 				 Hit TAB twice to enter the href. Hit TAB again to enter the link text! -->
 	a

 	<!-- Some tags don't play nice, like header (<h1><h2>etc..) tags for example. If tab completion isn't
 	working for a particular tag try typing adding < and then typing the tag name. You should
 	see a dropdown list with options to autocomplete that tag. -->


<!-- Exercise 3: HTML tags w/classes -->
	<!-- Say, I need a div with a class name of "quick-fast-now", immediately! 
	Place your cursor directly under the arrow ↓ and hit TAB.-->
				  <!--↓-->
	div.quick-fast-now

	<!-- You can do this with pretty much any HTML tag. 
	Pro tip: use dots for classes and hash tags for ID's.
	Go 'head, try a few below! -->
	p#sAndQs
	section#myId
	ul.some-class

<!-- Exercise 4: The amazing tag hug -->
	<!-- So I've got the following markup. Turns out this <ul> tag 
	needs to be surrounded by a div with the class name
	"my-class". Using a handy Sublime shortcut you may have learned 
	in another lesson, place your cursor at the beginning of the line preceding <ul>,
	hit `Command + L` until you've selected the next line directly after </ul> (6 times by my count), then hit `Command + Control + W` and type div class="my-class".
	Notice this shortcut automagically surrounds the selected markup in a <div>
	and properly adds the class to just the opening tag. Neat, huh? -->

	<ul>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
	</ul>

<!-- Exercise 5: Closing tag shortcut -->
	<!-- This has nothing to do with tab completion...but it's a helpful tool for 
	dealing with HTML tags so I figured I'd throw it in this group of exercises.
	Below I have an opening HTML tag and some text. Instead of manually typing
	out the matching closing tag, try the key combination `Command + Option + .` --> 


	<strong>So bold

	<!-- Yeah..so what? It's just one tag, right? This works for nested tags, too!
	To prove it hit `Command + Option + .` three times (or as many times as you have unclosed tags) -->

	<div><ul><li>Ima list item!
