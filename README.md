I've included the file structure from another lesson so you can try out Sublime Text's split window modes.

Use the key commands above and try dragging files from the different folders to the resulting split windows to find new ways to organize your work flow!

For example, try using ⌥⌘2 to split your Sublime Text environment into two columns. Then, drag index.html to one column, and css/style.css to another. Now you can visibly work on both files at the same time.


## Some clarification on key commands
All of the keyboard shortcuts in these lessons involve at least one modifier key (Command ⌘, Control ^, etc) followed by predicate key which completes the shortcut and triggers the desired action.

For example, let's take the shortcut ⌘X
This means depress and hold the Command (⌘) modifier key and then press the letter 'X'.

If you see ⌘KK or ⌘K⌘K, this means depress and hold Control (⌘) and press the letter 'K' twice.

Should you come across several modifier keys such as ⌃⇧K
then this means depress and hold Control (⌃), depress and hold Shift (⇧), then press the letter 'K'

Each lesson should have a legend for the modifier keys as well as these instructions as a reminder.
