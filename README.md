# Learn and Practice Sublime Text 3 Shortcuts

## Introduction
This project is about learning how to most effectively use **Sublime Text 3 (ST3)**. While there are awesome references on-line, many of them don't provide the space needed to actually practice, and internalize, the key shortcuts.

Hopefully this project will give you just that, a way to practice using ST3 shortcuts that will make you wicked fast while coding!

## Format
There are different directories containing information and lessons that cover the majority of Sublime Text use cases. Please add any additional lessons in a similar way.

## Next Steps
To see which lessons are available, type `git branch -r` in your local repo to see which ones are available on Github. Then, use `git checkout <LESSON-NAME>` to work through a particular lesson.

If at any point you wish to reset your work, simply save the file and then use `git checkout .` and you will be returned to the original state of the lesson.

Below is a list of the current lessons identified by branch names, along with a short description.

## Some clarification on key commands
All of the keyboard shortcuts in these lessons involve at least one modifier key (Command ⌘, Control ^, etc) followed by predicate key which completes the shortcut and triggers the desired action.

For example, let's take the shortcut ⌘X
This means depress and hold the Command (⌘) modifier key and then press the letter 'X'.

If you see ⌘KK or ⌘K⌘K, this means depress and hold Control (⌘) and press the letter 'K' twice.

Should you come across several modifier keys such as ⌃⇧K
then this means depress and hold Control (⌃), depress and hold Shift (⇧), then press the letter 'K'

Each lesson should have a legend for the modifier keys as well as these instructions as a reminder.
