# Learn and Practice Sublime Text 3 Shortcuts

## Introduction
This project is about learning how to most effectively use Sublime Text 3 (ST3). While there are awesome tutorials on-line, many of them don't provide the space needed to actually practice, and internalize, the key shortcuts and options.

Hopefully this project will give you just that, a way to practice using ST3 shortcuts that will make you wicked fast while coding!

## Format
The format of this project is to use different git branches for different lessons. This way, it will be easy for anyone to add their own lessons to allow everyone else to practice.

Please feel free to fork this repo and create your own lessons (or edit already existing ones). If you do decide to add your own lesson, please follow these steps to ensure each lesson is kept cleans from the ones before it:

1. Create an emtpy branch: `git checkout --orphan LESSON-NAME`
2. Delete all files in the working directory: `git rm -rf .`

I think together we will be able to make a collection of lessons that will help everyone get better at ST3.

## Next Steps
I've started creating a few lessons that will hopefully help you practice some ST3 shortcuts. To see which ones are available, type `git branch -r` in your local repo to see which ones are available on Github.

Alternatively, I've included a list of the current lessons identified by branch names, along with a short description.

## Lessons

* **(summary)**: A listing of ST3 shortcuts and a description of what they do
* **(multiple-cursors)**: A lesson on how to use ST3's multiple cursors to replace multiple words.

## Additional Resources
These lessons were created using the following resources:
