<!-- Exercise 3: 		⇧⌘L  Split into lines 

		Let's say we copied this list of Texas cities from the Internet and
	we want to convert them to strings and insert them in this JavaScript Array.
	Also, say we have to do this for every Texas city, not just the A's. Uh..that'd take awhile, right?
	
		Although there are many ways to solve this problem, Sublime text has a neato
	built in way to do this.

	1. First: Select all the cities inside the array brackets [].

	2. Use ⇧⌘L to split the selection into individual line selections. Notice you now 
	have a cursor at the end of every line!

	3. Since each line is individually selected, you can easily wrap each one
	in  quotes by typing '

	4. Next, move the cursor back to the end of the line with the right arrow 
	and add a comma.

	5. Use ⌘] to indent the cities.

	6. Finally, hit esc to return your selection to just one item (or click
	somewhere with your mouse). -->
