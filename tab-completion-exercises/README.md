# Learn and Practice Sublime Text Tab Completion Shortcuts

Check out the exercises in html-tab-completion-excercises.html to learn some cool tab completion shortcuts in Sublime Text.

## Some clarification on key commands
All of the keyboard shortcuts in these lessons involve at least one modifier key (Command ⌘, Control ^, etc) followed by predicate key which completes the shortcut and triggers the desired action.

For example, let's take the shortcut ⌘X
This means depress and hold the Command (⌘) modifier key and then press the letter 'X'.

If you see ⌘KK or ⌘K⌘K, this means depress and hold Control (⌘) and press the letter 'K' twice.

Should you come across several modifier keys such as ⌃⇧K
then this means depress and hold Control (⌃), depress and hold Shift (⇧), then press the letter 'K'

Each lesson should have a legend for the modifier keys as well as these instructions as a reminder.
